08 Next Steps & What I Need from You

To begin implementation please provide:

1) Representative Excel files (5–10 rows each) matching the abstracts and inclusion/session mapping. If the sheet shape deviates from the shapes described, indicate the structure.
2) Confirm the column header that contains the hospital/affiliation if you want it extracted.
3) Optionally, provide any exact typst templates or preferred fonts. If not, I'll create a starter template referencing system fonts.

If you want, I can proceed to create the Rust project skeleton and initial modules now; I will not parse real Excel files until you provide them, but I'll include fixtures and unit tests for the parsing logic.

Next actions (pick one):
- Upload Excel samples and I will start Phase 1 parsing and markdown generation. (Recommended)
- Ask me to scaffold the Rust project and include starter tests and typst template; you'll provide Excel later. Reply: "Scaffold".
