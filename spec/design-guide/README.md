Region H Digital Design Guide (mirrored)

This directory mirrors the Region H digital design guide assets required for
the project so the repository no longer needs to reference the external
website. Files included here are intended to be public assets; ensure you
have permission to include any licensed resources before committing.

Files:
- `RegionH_designguide_2025.pdf` — full PDF of the design guide (added when downloaded).
- `tokens.md` — extracted color, spacing and typography tokens (generated).
- `icons/` — small set of required icons used in templates (placeholders or extracted SVGs).
